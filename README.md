Just a quick look at whether its all circumstancial evidence or not.

## What do we wanna know?
### 1. Is it possible to label SUI investors' addresses with high confidence? Team addresses? If no, explain why and provide a detailed answer with your research and hypotheses on the team and investor allocation addresses.
The allegations made on insider trading are rather circumstantial and made with little to no evidence.
Light did not provide a list of wallets and it smells similar to the recent allegations surrounding Justin Sun (which all were circumstantial evidence at best).

In court, circumstantial evidence would not matter, so why should it in public?

Now the base question is. Can wallet from the team or investors be labelled with high accuracy?

-> 

First we look up whether any addresses have been publically mentioned. In this case, that's 0. 
Then we can run against various sources to see if others have succeeded in labelling wallets. Think Nansen, Dune or Arkham. Funnily, the answer is once again 0.
What can we do next? Well we can try to approximate various holdings by looking at tokenomics, unlock schedules and past information on IDOs, launchpools etc.
We can also, be extremely tedious and time consuming and go back to the origin of the token and track every damn transaction from the initial wallets to see, which wallets had what allocation, which smart contracts are set up in what way etc.
Also?? Staked number going down when price go up? Left curve take

NOTE!! The above are preliminary thoughts and a pessimistic take based on the fact that NO ONE has found anything till now. This means there is nothing, or that no one cares enough cause price go up (When allegations happened). 

### 2. If yes, verify the numbers provided by Light. Are his estimations correct, and did the investors sell so many tokens during this timeframe? Or is he wrong? If he is wrong, share your estimations.


### 3. How much SUI have the insiders (investors) sold after the Light’s post? Is there any change in dynamics? Please provide the chart showing the sales over time. For this task, you can assume that any transfer to exchange means selling.


### 4. How many tokens have the team and the foundation sold over time? Provide the same chart.
