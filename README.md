Just a quick look at whether its all circumstancial evidence or not.

## What do we wanna know?
### 1. Is it possible to label SUI investors' addresses with high confidence? Team addresses? If no, explain why and provide a detailed answer with your research and hypotheses on the team and investor allocation addresses.


### 2. If yes, verify the numbers provided by Light. Are his estimations correct, and did the investors sell so many tokens during this timeframe? Or is he wrong? If he is wrong, share your estimations.


### 3. How much SUI have the insiders (investors) sold after the Light’s post? Is there any change in dynamics? Please provide the chart showing the sales over time. For this task, you can assume that any transfer to exchange means selling.


### 4. How many tokens have the team and the foundation sold over time? Provide the same chart.
